\maketitle
\subsection*{Introduction} The customer, the Computing Science Department of Gaelic University, desires to implement a system which would allow automation of delivering marks to students. It will involve input into the system by students and lecturers and will allow advisors and program directors to access information available to them. A system administrator role should also be implemented for purposes of maintenance and override control of the system. It should be noted that a \emph{scrum} development style is being employed for this project. The customer desired for development to be done by a single student developer. An iteration cycle length of 30 ideal days is being used for the purposes of this report.

\subsection*{User Role Privileges}
Information access privileges play a key role in the system; as such, user privileges must be clearly defined. A \emph{Student} user is lowest level, having access to their own information only. \emph{Student} can also view but not change their own grades. The next level is shared by \emph{Lecturer} and \emph{Advisor}, who have access to their own information as well as to that of the given students under their respective tutelage/guidance. Above them is the role of \emph{Program Director}, who has access to information on all \emph{Students} in the program. Finally, the \emph{System Administrator} has access to all information used and stored by all users, as they must be able to access all facets of the system for the purpose of error correction on any level.

\subsection*{Release Plan}
The development of this task has been determined to have an iteration length of 30 ideal days per development cycle. The sum total of estimated ideal days for full development as described in this report is 74 ideal days. Thus, this software will necessitate a multi-stage release plan, based on the immediacy with which certain activities are required, or how critical they are to the core functionality desired by the program. For this reason, each story card that has been addressed has been assigned a priority level. The program should be completable within 3 full iterations, but it must be noted that during the second and third development cycles, time will need to be assigned to bug fixes, among other work, that cannot be accounted for at present as it is impossible to make accurate predictions of the time this will consume. These are assigned a recommendation of 4 ideal days to additional work, hence the second development cycle involves only 26 days of covering user stories. Note that is likely to be a far from accurate estimate.
\paragraph{First Iteration Cycle}
The first iteration should complete as much of the core functionality of the program as possible. The total time required to complete all user stories marked as must have is 38 days, thus there is some overspill into the second development cycle. The first iteration will involve addressing the following user stories:
\begin{itemize}
\item{\textcolor{red}{All Users: Login}}
\item{\textcolor{red}{Student: Course Entry}}
\item{\textcolor{red}{Student: View Grades}}
\item{\textcolor{red}{Lecturer: Upload Marks}}
\item{\textcolor{red}{Lecturer: Process Mark Sheet}}
\item{\textcolor{red}{Advisor: Verify Student Enrolment}}
\item{\textcolor{red}{Program Director: Access Mark Sheet}}
\item{\textcolor{red}{Program Director: Decide Pass/Fail}}
\item{\textcolor{red}{System Administrator: Update System}}
\end{itemize}
These total to 30 story points, and thus should be achievable within the prescribed timeframe. This cycle should end with the first release of the program.
\paragraph{Second Iteration Cycle}
The second iteration should aim to address the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item{\textcolor{red}{System Administrator: Change A Student's Classes}}
\item{\textcolor{red}{System Administrator: Change A Student's Grades}}
\item{\textcolor{mauve}{Student: Course Alteration}}
\item{\textcolor{mauve}{Lecturer: View Mark Sheet}}
\item{\textcolor{mauve}{Lecturer: Review Appeal}}
\item{\textcolor{mauve}{Advisor: View Mark Sheet}}
\item{\textcolor{mauve}{Advisor: View Feedback}}
\item{\textcolor{mauve}{System Administrator: View All Classes}}
\item{\textcolor{mauve}{System Administrator: View All Grades}}
\item{\textcolor{dkgreen}{Student: File Appeal}}
\item{\textcolor{dkgreen}{Student: Mark Absence}}
\end{itemize}
These total to 26 story points. Accounting for the assigned 4 ideal days for maintenance, bug fixes and other development needs this reaches the 30 ideal days for the development cycle.
\paragraph{Third Iteration Cycle}
The final iteration should seek to address the following remaining user stories:
\begin{itemize}
\item{\textcolor{dkgreen}{Student: Request Feedback}}
\item{\textcolor{dkgreen}{Lecturer: Confirm Absence}}
\item{\textcolor{dkgreen}{Lecturer: Give Feedback}}
\item{\textcolor{dkgreen}{Advisor: View Mark Sheet}}
\item{\textcolor{blue}{Student: Request Mark Sheet}}
\item{\textcolor{blue}{Student: Pass/Fail Request}}
\item{\textcolor{blue}{Lecturer: Pass/Fail Request}}
\item{\textcolor{blue}{Advisor: Contact Failing Students}}
\end{itemize}

The final iteration will take 22 ideal days when accounting again for 4 ideal days for maintenance, bug fixes and other development, and 18 story points. Thus this final iteration will not require a full development cycle.

\subsection*{Appendix: Uncertainties and Assumptions}
\textbf{Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Assume rapid response time not an issue, most operations are small and it is assumed that the maximum processing time for any will be insignificant on a modern computer.}\item{Assume system does not have to generate credentials for users, these already exist and system simply makes use of them.}
\item{Assume most of could have/would like to have functionality are things users could do outside of program, such as contacting each other via email, but software would facilitate automation of. Thus, their relegation to lower priority does not reflect importance of task, more the ease with which it can be done independently of this system.}
\item{Assume that functionality of the program will be delivered within one GUI environment, which presents different options to the user based on privilege of user role.}
\item{Assume that it is acceptable to release the program without the System Administrator having the ability to change student's classes or grades and accept that this functionality can wait until second release.}
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Uncertainties}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Unknown whether customer has a database or other computer systems that they desire this software to be integrated with.}
\item{Unknown whether customer would prefer system as a web application or stand alone program, and what level of cross-platform would be required for a stand alone system.}
\item{Unknown if customer already has systems to control marking absences from exams or making appeals for grades. If so these user stories are redundant in this project.}
\end{itemize}
